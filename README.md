# Fluorophone-App---UbiComp-Lab


Most molecular reactions, from synthetic biology experiments to COVID diagnostics, require expensive and bulky lab equipment to achieve sensitive and accurate readouts. In the FluoroPhone project, I investigated ways to use the smartphone sensors and actuators (mainly, the camera and flash) to elicit high sensitivity while drastically reducing the cost of reading these reactions.  This may enable field-based diagnostic testing and more accessible biological experimentation in the future.  I worked on Android development for a custom camera app that gives us fine-grained control over the camera settings (exposure, focus, color gains) and automated image processing for lab results.  This project involved learning about low-level Android APIs (camera2, etc) as well as computer vision processing (OpenCV) and visualization in Python (Matplotlib).

This project was mentioned in the [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QYvuSYWrRh2ZLmsI3N58XPHfKviTUhZi/view?usp=drive_link) that was submitted and accepted at the DNA29 Conference
